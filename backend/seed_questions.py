        "ai_answer": "React's reconciliation algorithm efficiently updates the DOM through a process called 'diffing'. When state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one. The algorithm makes two assumptions: 1) Elements of different types will produce different trees (so it replaces the entire subtree). 2) Keys help identify stable elements across renders. The algorithm works in O(n) time by comparing trees level by level, updating only changed nodes. This is crucial for performance as direct DOM manipulation is expensive; React minimizes these operations by batching updates and only touching necessary DOM nodes.",
